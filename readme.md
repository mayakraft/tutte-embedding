# Tutte embedding

squash a 3D model (.obj file) into a flat plane, render some kind of feedback as to where the excess paper must be gathered, and in which direction, to achieve a general folding that approximates the input model.

The input .obj file must be very particular, it must be watertight all over, except for a single boundary line; faces along the boundadry contain raw edges.

A good example is a face mask without any nostrils/ear/eye/mouth holes.
